# This repo outlines me creating a personal website!
## Big shoutout to hack club for motivating this!


# description and exigence

For this website, I had some basic goals:
- keep the visuals simple 
- clean aesthetic
- have a display of my projects, a blog, and a contact me page


I did some web-dev stuff 5 years ago, so I forgot most everything, so it has been fun re-learning

Big shout out to Claude for helping me through implmenting modal elements of the blog. It was definelty a shift moving from vibe-coding in Highway to actually coding here, but it was enjoyable 

Something I'm proud about is figuring out the github API so I can have all my repos automatically populate in the projects tab, including this website right here!

I am probably going to prototype a new UI in figma later, because this design is pretty basic. I am alos looking to add dark-mode as a future feature. 

Overall great experience and am looking for feedback on how to improve it!
